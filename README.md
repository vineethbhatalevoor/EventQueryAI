## 🖥️ Example Usage

### **Query:**
What events are scheduled on 2025-01-26?
**Output:**
Event Name         | Event Date
---------------------------------
Republic Day       | 2025-01-26

**Response:
On January 26, 2025, Republic Day is scheduled to be celebrated.
Republic Day is a national holiday in India, marking the Constitution's enactment in 1950.**
